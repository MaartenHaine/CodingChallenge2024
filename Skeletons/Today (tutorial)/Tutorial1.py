"""
You are a normal worker at the institution of time, or so you thought.
Suddenly, you notice alarms going off everywhere around you.
Everyone but your team is panicking at the sight of this sudden threat.
ChatGPT has managed to get into the past!
There is an influx of all sorts of weird time anomalies.
Before you try to handle these, you should make a program that counts how many anomalies are actually harmful.

Given is a list with multiple values.
Your task, if you choose to accept it,
is to count the amount of times 'b' (b for bad) is a value in the list.

Example:
    Given the list
    lijst = ['g','g','b','g','b']
    Counter should return 2, because there are 2 elements in the list 'b'.

"""

### INPUT - DO NOT TOUCH
lijst = eval(input())
### END INPUT


def counter(lijst: list):
    return 0


print(counter(lijst))
