"""
You have now gathered some words, but it is rather difficult to find a specific word in the list.
You should implement a way to sort the list alphabetically.

Given a list with words, sort them on alphabetical basis (a->z).
The given words can include words with capital letters, but they should not be prioritised.

Note: when using sort(), capital words get prioritised over lower letter words.
