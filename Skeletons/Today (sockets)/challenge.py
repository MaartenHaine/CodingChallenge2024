You are analyzing a foreign network, and you come across a computer on the domain bcc.local
with an open socket on port 12345. After successfully establishing a tcp connection,
you send a number to the socket, and the system responds with a seemingly random number.

Your task is to figure out the mathematical function that is running on the server's
side based on the inputs and outputs you observe.
example:
    function = \sum_{n=0}^{inf}0.1^n*cos(3^n*pi*x)
